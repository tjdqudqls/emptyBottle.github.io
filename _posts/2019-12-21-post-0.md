## Starting my blog.

Hello, this is Byeong-Bin Seong, or simply BB.

I'm a Korean game developer, currently working in Korea, looking forward to work abroad on AAA titles.

Unfortunately, I have no professional C++ experience, which is asked for almost every single AAA developer position. Job seeking did not go well :( 

So I decided to work on personal projects to prove what I am capable of outside my professional career.

I had the need of keeping track of my ideas, projects and etc.

So, I ended up making this blog.

My goal in 2020 is to make my own 2D physics engine.

Hopefully, this blog will allow me to write about the challenges I have faced, researches I have done, showing off my work or maybe about my personal life.
